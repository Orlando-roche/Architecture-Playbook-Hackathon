= Architecture Guiding Principles
:sectnums:

These principles guide our ambitions for how we intend to design, build, scale, and evolve the system landscape across the Computational Sciences Center of Excellence (CS CoE). They reflect our shared architectural commitments and guide the direction we collectively agree to pursue; deviations should be reviewed through the exception process to ensure consistency and good decision-making.

Each principle includes a Description (what we commit to), a Why (the underlying rationale), and an Impact (the outcomes we expect when we apply it effectively).

== Principle: Start with Business Impact – Deliver, Measure, and Scale What Works

=== Description
We begin by aligning our deliverables to the business objectives defined by the REDs. We deliver iteratively, incorporating continuous customer feedback, and validate our outcomes against the business’s success criteria, scaling only what creates proven value.

=== Why
Impact-driven, evidence-based delivery ensures we focus our time and investment on what truly matters. Our patients are waiting.

=== Impact
* Clear success criteria for every initiative
* Strong alignment with business goals and needs
* Quicker validation of ideas, reducing risk and evolving with evidence
* Scaling is driven by evidence rather than assumption

== Principle: Design for Reuse – Modular and Integration-Ready by Design

=== Description
We prioritize reuse by evaluating existing solutions, starting with open-source products, then commercial off-the-shelf solutions, and only considering building from scratch as a last resort, while articulating the architectural rationale when reuse is not viable. Evolving towards modular, loosely coupled, and interoperable components that can be reused and composed ensures accelerated delivery across domains.

=== Why
Reusability mindset reduces duplication and improves ROI, while modular design enables agility, interoperability, and long-term scalability.

=== Impact
* Faster delivery with the flexibility to adjust and iterate as needs evolve.
* Reduction of duplicated systems and fragmented tooling - more harmonized landscape.
* Independent evolution of services, enabling easier deprecation and consolidation
* Greater consistency and architectural coherence data across teams and domains

== Principle: Innovate at the Core

=== Description
We strive for applying cloud where it makes sense, i.e. cloud-first, cloud-native, SaaS-first, AI-enabled, API-driven architecture that enables rapid innovation and scalability.
* *Cloud-first* means we prioritize the cloud, but are not cloud-only.
* *Cloud-native* means we leverage cloud-providers specific capabilities as an accelerator, rather than being cloud agnostic.
* *AI-ready* means we increasingly embed AI into how we design, build, operate and govern our systems, while also ensuring our systems are AI-ready.

[NOTE]
While our current state does not yet fully achieve this principle, this is the direction we are intentionally moving towards.

=== Why
Enable rapid innovation and integrated ecosystems, and create a seamless environment where machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies can thrive.

=== Impact
* Drives rapid innovation
* More rapid delivery through managed services and SaaS adoption
* Seamless integration via APIs and open standards
* Designed for AI from the beginning

== Principle: Automate for Scale with Embedded Observability

=== Description
We automate repeatable, manual, labor intensive work across infrastructure, applications, data, and processes to scale reliably. We design systems with built-in observability, which includes usage monitoring of applications, so we can continuously debug, understand, and improve them. Our scientific stakeholders rely on our solutions and data, making it essential to build and maintain their trust - critical for the ultimate outcome: delivering medicines faster to patients.

=== Why
Automation enables scale without proportional effort and reduces operational risk. Observability ensures we can detect, diagnose, and improve continuously.

=== Impact
* Faster detection and resolution of issues
* Supports rapid scaling without proportional increases in effort or resources.
* Enables consistent, repeatable processes that can be measured and optimized.
* More time and focus for innovation

== Principle: Collaborate to Elevate

=== Description
We collaborate, communicate transparently and share knowledge, designs, code, and decisions to achieve collective outcomes and foster trust. We will work in the open (e.g. documented designs and code, documented decisions, peer reviews) and ensure artifacts are searchable. This is critical as we create the CS CoE organization, and we bring together different cultures, geographies, ways of working, approaches, and strengths.

=== Why
Open collaboration accelerates innovation and builds alignment across diverse teams and disciplines.

=== Impact
* Strengthens relationships, build credibility and trust - crucial for gaining consensus
* Promotes exchange of ideas, data, and components
* Accelerates decision-making process across the organization through transparency
* A learning culture that attracts and retains talent

== Principle: Secure & Compliant by Default

=== Description
We embed security, privacy, and compliance into every design — not as an afterthought - in alignment with Roche corporate guidelines. This includes patient data, licensed/purchased data with contractual restrictions, and data subject to geographic or jurisdictional regulations. At the same time, we design access models that enable appropriate, governed sharing.

=== Why
Protecting our intellectual property and data is essential for sustainable innovation, faster delivery, and regulatory compliance.

=== Impact
* Reduces risk of data loss, non-compliance, and rework through early, built-in controls
* Increases transparency and strengthens confidence in audit readiness
* Accelerates delivery by automating security and governance
* Enables seamless collaboration and data sharing across domains

== Principle: Design for Resilience and Adaptability

=== Description
We architect solutions with modularity and flexibility, embedding fault tolerance as a core design tenant. In research and early development, our business priorities shift rapidly, data modalities evolve, and workflows and technologies are constantly changing and improving. Our systems must keep pace with this and scale, pivot, or recover without major redesign.

=== Why
In gRED and pRED, business priorities, technologies, and regulatory landscapes continuously evolve. Systems that cannot adapt quickly or recover gracefully from disruptions slow down innovation, productivity and increase operational risk.

=== Impact
* Lower cost for adapting to rapid changes to business processes
* Higher uptime and resilience during scientific experiment cycles that cannot be disrupted or delayed
* Reduce downtime, minimizes cost of change
* Ensures technology investments remain relevant and dependable even under constant evolution

== Principle: FAIR Data By Design

=== Description
We ensure all systems, applications, pipelines, and processes are designed to enable Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data from creation through consumption. Data is core to everything we do in the CS CoE.

=== Why
FAIR data accelerates discovery, enables reproducibility, and can power AI. It ensures that data can be trusted, reused, and integrated seamlessly across the ecosystem.

=== Impact
* Data is easily discoverable through searchable metadata
* Access is secure, automated, traceable with the right governance structure
* Enable cross-domain interoperability
* Improve reproducibility and accelerate AI development
