= Data Workflow Documentation Best Practices
:page-content-owner-email: thomas.thies@roche.com

== Objective 
This documents aims to highlight the best practices around the miniminimal information to be provided as data workflow/pipeline documentation as defined in the Data & Workflows Engineering Capability Circle.

* The documentation of the workflow should be readable by end-users without having to access the code
* It needs to be accessible by everyone, not only by users of the code (findability)
* In-scope of this best practice are automated or semi-automated computational workflows such as data processing/transformation pipelines
* Out-of-scope are manual or business workflows (e.g. assay/experiment protocols, etc.)

|Information
|Purpose
|Mandatory vs. Optional

|Title → Comprehensive but crisp and unambiguous title
|
|M

|Version → Current version of the Workflow using Semantic Versioning Scheme (https://semver.org/)
|E.g. first release v1, small change v1.1., larger change v2… for versions that are made available to other users
|M

|Version History/Changelog
|
|O

|Workflow Owner/Maintainer ((team) name and email)
|
|M

|Description → Brief abstract about the purpose of the workflow extending the title (e.g. modalities, types of data, outputs of the workflow) 
|
|M

|Steps of workflow including description (component/software tool used, version of tool, command line executed, including manual steps)
|In brief, this can be a more holistic and detailed description. It should inform the reader what is used.
|M

|Diagram of the workflow
|
|O

|Tags or keywords (e.g. data types)
|For searching in case a workflow registry is available, independent of the used platform
|O

|Workflow Category/Type of Analysis → (type (preprocessing, QC), technology (single cell, rnaseq, image processing))
|Existing in RTS, genomic, transcriptomic, single-cell, imaging, other/to be defined -> as drop-down/selection?
|M

|Tools/programming language (Python, Pipeline Pilot, KNIME, etc)
|If a user wants to search for workflows created in a tool he/she already knows
|O

|Source code location or external documentation (“How to” of workflow)
|Link or link to Wiki page
|M

|Inputs including type (e.g. type of data or file format etc.) and description
|
|M

|Outputs including description/type
|
|M

|Is workflow non-restricted or requires access? (if requires access, how to apply for access)
|
|M

|Any licensing regarding the tools used
|
|O

|Any licensing regarding the data (for which the workflow was created; if this is unclear reach out to DWE circle)
|
|O
