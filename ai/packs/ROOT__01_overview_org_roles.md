---

## Architecture Community

Our architectural practice is enabled by the dedicated Architecture group and extended throughout the organization by our Architecture Catalysts, ensuring that we maintain architectural coherence while embedding strategic alignment across all Research and Early Development domains.

### The Architecture Group

The core Architecture group is part of CSCoE-DDC organization and oversees the architectural direction and governance within the Computational Sciences Center of Excellence (CS-CoE).

**Contact**: CSCoE-DDC-EA-d@gene.com

### Architecture Catalysts

The Catalysts serve as the first point of contact between their respective departments and the Architecture group, promoting architectural alignment and ensuring that best practices are followed. They are members of the Architecture Council and the Architecture Review Board.

**Contact**: CSCOE-ARCHITECTURE-CATALYST@msxdl.roche.com

## Architecture Bodies

Our operating model relies on defined architectural bodies to ensure coherent, consistent, and scalable architecture practices across the CS-CoE and the broader organization.

### Core Architecture Team

The Architecture group is responsible for overseeing the architectural direction and governance within the Computational Sciences Center of Excellence (CS-CoE). The team ensures that architectural standards are maintained, best practices are followed, and that the architecture aligns with the overall business goals and strategies.

### Architecture Council

**Purpose**: Connect the Core Architecture Team with the broader CS-CoE organization and the REDs. Promote architectural alignment, increase awareness of architectural topics, and collaboratively address architectural challenges and develop and refine architectural strategies.

**Members**: Core Architecture Team and the Architecture Catalysts.

### Architecture Review Forum

**Purpose**: Reviews and approves architectural designs, decisions, and changes within the CS-CoE. The forum ensures consistent, high-quality architectural decisions by providing a structured platform to review, align and approve significant design choices across the REDs.

**Decision Process**:
- Decisions are made by the Architecture Department, guided by the Architecture Guardrails
- Architecture Catalysts and Subject Matter Experts participate as consultative members
- If no clear consensus is reached, the Head of Architecture serves as the final decision authority
- All outcomes are captured and published as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Members**: Core Team + Architecture Catalysts + on-demand SMEs.

### Architecture Workgroup

Rapid, Cross-Functional Execution for Targeted Architecture Needs.

- Purpose-driven teams formed to deliver a specific architecture outcome
- Cross-functional: including Architecture Catalysts and subject matter experts
- Time-bound: exist for no longer than three months to ensure focus and agility
- Outcome-focused: produce concrete deliverables such as blueprints, design proposals or standards
- Each workgroup has a dedicated lead who ensures focus, progress and delivery

## Architecture Catalyst Role

The introduction of the Architecture Catalyst role is a strategic decision to mitigate the risk of the Core Architecture group becoming a bottleneck and to drive value across the CS-CoE by establishing robust and trustworthy relationships.

Architecture Catalysts are individuals within the organization who act as a bridge between the Architecture Department and the broader organisation. They collaborate with the Core Architecture Team and serve as advocates for architecture, helping to better support and engage with the CS-CoE and the REDs on navigate architectural challenges.

### Role Purpose and Characteristics

- **Connecting Role**: This role focuses on Connecting People, Strategy, and Technology
- **Comprehensive Understanding**: Architecture Catalysts are individuals with a deep understanding of specific areas within the Research and Early Development (REDs)' digital landscape
- **Alignment**: They ensure alignment between the wider organization and the Architecture Department
- **First Contact Point**: They serve as the first point of contact for communication between their respective department and the Architecture team
- **Guardrail Adherence**: They are responsible for ensuring that Architecture best practices and processes are followed
