This file contains ADRs from years prior to the current rolling window.

## Pre-2025 ADRs

*No ADRs from before 2025 are currently available in this repository.*

The CS-CoE Architecture Playbook was established in 2025 with the creation of the Computational Sciences Center of Excellence. As the organization matures, older ADRs will be moved to this archive.

## Archive Policy

ADRs are moved to the archive when:
